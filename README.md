# Ascaris suum Atlas

Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are among the most common infections worldwide. The eggs of STH exhibit remarkable survival capabilities and can rapidly initiate development and infection in response to temperature. However, the temperature-dependent process of STH development and infection are unclear at cellular levels. Here, we report the discovery of the cellular basis underlying the development and infection of Ascaris suum, which relies on the molecular thermosensor Twk-18. We perform single-cell sequencing of 233,826 cells throughout the whole developmental stages (58 distinct cellular states) of A. suum. The embryonic development trajectory reveals that the gastrula and L2 larval stage were critical periods for organogenesis and infection. Electrophysiological experiments showed that Twk-18 functions as a core thermosensor for sensing environmental temperature. We further validate that inhibition of Twk-18 turns the larvae into temperature-insensitive, experiencing reduced vitality, and potentially losing their infectivity, providing a promising cellular target for controlling global STH infections.
